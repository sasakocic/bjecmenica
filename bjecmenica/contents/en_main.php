        I was 22 years old when I was forced to leave Yugoslavia due to a
        federal judge who ordered me to leave and never return. The reason for his
        doing this was because I was adamant that communism was an evil system.
        In 1969, I set out for the United States of America and settled in Cleveland,
        Ohio, where I lived for the next 12 years. I spent my free time learning
        the English language so I could work and relate with others and succeed

      I believe that it is important to inform you that apostle John, while he was on the island Patmos, had a
      revelation. The Lord Jesus Christ has declared through His angel what will happen in the last days until the end
      of the world and in the eternity. We are warned not to receive the mark of the beast that is already producing <a

      <b>Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon! Are we ready?</b><br>
      John 14:1-6 "Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. 2 "In My Father's house are
      many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 "And if I go and
      prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. 4
      "And where I go you know, and the way you know." 5 Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going,
      and how can we know the way?" 6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the
      Father except through Me.(NKJ)

      The Lord Jesus Christ gives us the gift of the Holy Spirit if we pray with our whole hearts. The Holy Spirit in
      communion with our spirit makes us the children of God. When we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, through
      the Holy Spirit, then the Lord God hears our prayers and answers them. Let us know that the Holy Spirit counsels
      us, teaches us, heals us, gives us consolation and helps us to live the life of Christ and to have His holy
      character. Then we can be sure that we are ready for his coming from heaven for us.

    <td colspan="2">The Lord Jesus Christ sacrificed himself for us and our salvation, two thousand years ago. Pontius
      Pilate, roman governor, sentenced him to be whipped. He stood the punishment on His own body and in His wounds we
      are healed. He is our healer of the spirit, soul and body. Then they put a crown of thorns on His head to mock
      Him. They spat on Him and beat His face. They bowed down and reviled Him: "Hello king of Judea!". Because of Him,
      we also can stand every mocking and shame when they persecute us for the faith in Christ.

    <td colspan="2">In the end they put Him up on the cross, by which he took the sins of every person on His body.
      Tasting death, He provided eternal life to anyone, if he repents. After His resurrection on the third day in His
      eternal (glorified) body, He went back to His heavenly throne at the right side of God the father on the fortieth
      day. Ten days later He sent the Holy Spirit that proceeds from the Father, to those that obey Him. That gift is
      for us, our children and for all as long as the mercy of God extends.
      It is still time of God's mercy, when you can decide to humble yourself and call Christ in your life, as your Lord
      and Saviour, to deliver you from sin and Satan's authority.

      Lord Jesus Christ, forgive me my sins, because I repent from every sin with which I have grieved You. Please,
      cleanse me with Your holy blood. Give me the Holy Spirit to become a child of God. Teach me how to pray in Your
