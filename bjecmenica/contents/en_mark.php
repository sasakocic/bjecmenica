  <h1>MARK OF THE BEAST</h1>

  <p>The future events revealed to John by an angel which are described in the Revelation shows that in the end times people will be forced to receive a mark</p>

  <p><i>Rev 13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six. (666)</i></p>

  <p>The souls of the slain will wait for justice</p>

  <p><i>Rev 6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they [were], should be fulfilled. </i></p>

  <p>Receiving of the mark will be subject to the wrath of God</p>

  <p><i>Rev 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</i></p>

  <p>and will cause pain afterwards</p>

  <p><i>Rev 16:2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievious sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and [upon] them which worshipped his image.</i></p>

  <p>and eternal punishment</p>
  
  <p><i>Rev 19:19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. 20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</i></p>

  <p>But those killed for the witness of Jesus that refuse to receive the mark will resurrect</p>

  <p><i>Rev 20:4  And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</i></p>

  <p>Be warned in the name of Jesus Christ and do not receive the mark of the beast! The IT technology for the mark is already present (To see a powerpoint presentation click <a href="../archive/mondex.pps">here...</a>)</p>
  
  <p>God bless you!</p>
